You use Files.lines to return a stream where each element is a line in the given file.
You then split each line into words by calling the split method on line. Notice how
you use flatMap to produce one flattened stream of words instead of multiple streams
of words for each line. Finally, you count each distinct word in the stream by chaining
the methods distinct and count.
